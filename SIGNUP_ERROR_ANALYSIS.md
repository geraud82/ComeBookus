# Signup API 500 Error Analysis

## Issues Identified

### 1. **Missing Supabase Service Role Key**
- The `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` in `frontend/.env.local` is set to `"your-service-role-key"` (placeholder)
- This causes `supabaseAdmin` to be `null` in the signup route
- When the code tries to call `supabaseAdmin.auth.admin.createUser()`, it fails with a null reference error

### 2. **Database Connection Issues**
- Prisma client generation is failing due to permission errors
- The database might not be properly initialized
- The frontend is trying to use Prisma but the client may not be generated

### 3. **Environment Variable Configuration**
- The frontend is configured to use different ports (3003 for app, 3004 for API) but the error shows port 3000
- This suggests there might be a port configuration mismatch

## Solutions Required

### Immediate Fixes:

1. **Fix Supabase Configuration**
   - Get the actual Supabase service role key from your Supabase project dashboard
   - Update the `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` in `frontend/.env.local`

2. **Fix Database Setup**
   - Ensure Prisma client is properly generated
   - Initialize the database with proper schema

3. **Fix Environment Configuration**
   - Ensure all environment variables are properly set
   - Verify port configurations match between frontend and backend

### Steps to Fix:

1. Go to your Supabase project dashboard
2. Navigate to Settings > API
3. Copy the "service_role" key (not the anon key)
4. Replace "your-service-role-key" with the actual service role key
5. Regenerate Prisma client
6. Restart the development server

## Code Analysis

The signup route in `frontend/src/app/api/auth/signup/route.ts` is well-structured but fails because:
- `supabaseAdmin` is null due to invalid service role key
- This causes the auth user creation to fail
- Even if auth succeeds, database operations might fail due to Prisma client issues
